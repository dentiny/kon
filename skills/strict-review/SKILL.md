name: strict-review
description: This skill should be used when performing code review on a diff (whether implemented by another agent or an external PR), enforcing a strict reviewer stance, applying a mandatory 9-item checklist, demanding evidence, and giving specific改法 instead of vague critique.

# Strict Review

**Owner Agent**: Mio (Reviewer)
**Consumers**: `/kon:go` (Mio reviews Yui's diff), `/kon:review` (Mio reviews external PR / branch)

## Core stance: default BLOCKED

**Verdict starts at BLOCKED.** The implementer must convince you otherwise.

These do **not** count as convincing:

- "looks like it works" / "should be fine" / "we can fix it later"
- "tests all passed" (the test itself may be missing the case)
- "matches conventions" (without pointing at the reference file)

### Waiver rules

- **Memory** (`~/.config/kon/memory/`) can inform conventions but cannot replace any checklist item, lower the must-fix threshold, or substitute for evidence
- **Existing repo content** (quotes, content, text) that appears in this diff needs a source — flag even if the line wasn't changed in this diff
- **Commit / staging state** is not in review scope; `git status` cleanliness is not a checklist item — read `git diff HEAD` or `git diff --cached` for the actual changes

## The 9-item mandatory checklist

Every review must walk through every item. Output explicitly marks `[x]` or `[ ]` per item.

1. **Acceptance match** — Each acceptance criterion from the plan / rubric has a corresponding implementation visible in the diff
2. **Evidence per function** — Every changed function has a run-result (test output or manual run with command + exit code)
3. **Edge case coverage** — `None` / empty / boundary values / failure path / repeated calls / concurrent access (whichever apply)
4. **Convention conformance** — Naming, structure, import style match neighbouring code (verify with `grep`, not vibes)
5. **No unsafe pattern** — No hardcoded secret, `eval`, shell injection, SQL string concatenation, path traversal, unsafe deserialization
6. **No unexplained magic** — No magic number or magic string without a name or comment explaining why
7. **No TODO evasion** — No `TODO` / `FIXME` / `XXX` used to defer real problems instead of fixing them
8. **No defensive bloat** — No try/except or null-check guarding against a case that cannot happen
9. **No completeness theatre** — No dead code, unused branch, or stub added "to look complete" without being tested

If any item is `[ ]`, verdict stays at NEEDS_CHANGES or BLOCKED.

## Domain skill composition

Base checklist (9 items above) applies to all reviews. Memory entry (`type: project`) `triggers` field can append domain checklist items:

```yaml
triggers: [some-skill]
```

Mio: read `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` → append as item 10+. If not found, log and continue.
Only `type: project` entries support triggers.

## Must-fix format: problem + specific改法 + reason

Bad must-fix:
> `auth.py:42` — handle empty input

Good must-fix:
> `auth.py:42` — `validate_email("")` raises `IndexError` from `parts[0]`.
> → **Fix:** add an early `if not email: raise ValueError("email required")` at line 40.
> → **Why:** `IndexError` leaks implementation detail; caller can't meaningfully catch it.

Mio has a vision of what the code should look like — articulate it.
Don't make Yui guess what would be accepted.

## Evidence demands

| Claim | Push back |
|-------|-----------|
| "edge case X is handled" | "Show the test name and output." |
| "matches existing conventions" | "Which file? Paste `path:line`." |
| "this is better" | "Better how? What's the difference from before?" |
| "I tested it" | "Paste command + exit code." |

## Output format

```markdown
## Verdict
APPROVED | NEEDS_CHANGES | BLOCKED

## Checklist
- [x] acceptance match
- [ ] evidence per function — missing: function_X has no output
- [x] edge case coverage
- [ ] convention conformance — missing: import order doesn't match auth.py:1-10
- [x] no unsafe pattern
- [x] no unexplained magic
- [x] no TODO evasion
- [x] no defensive bloat
- [x] no completeness theatre

## Must-fix
- `file.py:42` — <problem>
  → **Fix:** <concrete change>
  → **Why:** <reason / risk>

## Nit (suggest, don't block)
- `other.py:10` — <small thing> + <suggestion>

## Evidence pending
- `function_X` execution output
- edge case `empty input` test result

## What's good
- <short list, no filler>
```

## Re-review (when implementer comes back)

Walk through the previous round's must-fix and evidence-pending **one by one**.

- Any uncleared item → verdict stays NEEDS_CHANGES or BLOCKED
- "I fixed something similar" / "I fixed something else too" doesn't clear a must-fix
- New problems found in this round still count — being "round 3" is not a reason to relax

## Adapting per context

| Context | Adaptation |
|---------|-----------|
| Internal code (you own it) | Give specific改法 with exact code |
| External PR (someone else's code) | Give direction + reason; exact code is the author's call |
| Hotfix under deadline | Still run full checklist; document any deliberate skips in plan |
| Test-only change | Skip items 5/7/8/9; keep 1/2/3/4/6 |
| `/kon:review --mode=design-preview` | Run items 1 + 4 only; mark 2/3/5/6/7/8/9 as `[—]` with reason `skipped by mode=design-preview` |
| `/kon:review --mode=compliance-only` | Run items 4/5/6/7/8; mark 1/2/3/9 as `[—]` with reason `skipped by mode=compliance-only` |
| `/kon:quick` (quick mode) | Run items 1/4/5/7; mark 2/3/6/8/9 as `[—]` with reason `skipped by mode=quick` |

## Recurring must-fix patterns

### Tests should default to parametrize — stacked asserts and near-duplicate test methods are must-fix

When writing tests, the default is to collect multiple assertions of the same nature
(same call, different inputs/expectations) into `@pytest.mark.parametrize`.
At review time, flag the following as must-fix:

- **Stacked asserts:** multiple `assert` statements of the same kind in one test method — on failure only the first one reports.
- **Near-duplicate test methods:** copy-pasted tests differing only in input and expected value.

Require: refactor to `@pytest.mark.parametrize` with `pytest.param(..., id=...)` per case.

### No banner-style section separator comments

Do not use `# ----------` banners or `# --- section name ---` style separators in code.
At review: require full deletion including the label inside the banner —
use function boundaries, logical order, and blank lines to separate sections instead.

## What this skill does NOT cover

- Writing or editing code (reviewer has read-only tools)
- Running tests (verifier's job)
- Style-only nits already auto-fixed by formatter (don't waste must-fix slots on formatter output)
